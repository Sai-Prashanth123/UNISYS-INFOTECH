The features that challenged me the most 🧠

1️⃣ Real-time dashboard with live charts
2️⃣ Multi-SOW document upload system
3️⃣ Automatic revenue share calculation
4️⃣ Role-based security across 3 portals
5️⃣ Calendar-based timecard interface

Each one replaced a manual, error-prone process.

That's the power of building custom software 💪

## 🎬 REEL 6: "The Problem I Solved" (Story-style — 30-45 sec)

**HOOK:**
> "This company was running their entire operation on spreadsheets."

**SCRIPT:**

> An IT staffing company was tracking employee hours in Excel.
> Client contracts were in emails.
> Invoices were made in Word.
> Job applications were lost in inboxes.
>
> No real-time visibility. No security. No automation.
>
> So I built them a platform.
>
> Now employees log hours from their phone.
> Managers see updates in real time.
> Admins manage everything from one dashboard.
> Candidates apply online. Invoices calculate automatically.
>
> One platform replaced it all.

**CAPTION:**
```
They were running an entire business on spreadsheets and emails 📊

I built them a platform that handles EVERYTHING:
→ Employee timecards
→ Client management
→ Invoices & payroll
→ Job applications
→ Real-time dashboards
→ Document storage

Technology should make business easier, not harder.
